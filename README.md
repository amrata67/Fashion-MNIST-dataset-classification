# Fashion MNIST dataset classification
## Problem Statement: Implement neural network and convolutional neural network for the task of classification on fashion MNIST dataset.

## Conclusion:
Our project successfully implements neural network and convolutional neural network for the task of classification into 10 classes with the accuracy of 84 percent in one hidden layer NN , 85 percent in multi-layer NN and 88 percent in convolution NN.
Project helps us understand practical use of hidden layers, drop-off layer, different activation functions, convolution neural network, tuning hyper-parameters and visualizing the results along with the theoretical knowledge.
